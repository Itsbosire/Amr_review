# General Overview

This project aims to quantify the global burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through a systematic review of existing literature. AMR is a major public health challenge that threatens the efficacy of life-saving treatments, increasing the morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of infectious diseases.

The systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies across various regions and pathogens, focusing on resistance rates, healthcare impacts, and socio-economic consequences. Key metrics include mortality rates, treatment failures, and economic burdens associated with resistant infections.

The findings of this review will contribute to understanding the scale of AMR and inform global policy strategies to mitigate its effects. The project seeks to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing data to highlight the urgency of addressing AMR as a critical global health issue.
