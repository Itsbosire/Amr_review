## Introduction

Anti -Microbial Resistant (AMR) is causing widely concern around the world due to the potential impact on global population health , costs to Health care system in addition to GDP number ,The Review estimates that by 2050 the global cost of AMR will be up to $100 trillion and will account for 10 million extra deaths a year. which is being utilized by policy makers to push AMR up the political agenda.

The burden of antimicrobial resistance refers to the negative consequences in terms of health, economy, and social well-being caused by the ability of microorganisms to evade the effects of antimicrobial treatments.

The review was conducted through a systematic search in various databases, covering studies published between January 2013 and December 2015. The main objective was to identify and evaluate the methodologies used to estimate the AMR burden from various perspectives: patient, healthcare system (provider/payer), and economic.

Data extraction and quality assessment
Several statistical methodologies were used to compare the data collected in the studies. Software such as Microsoft Excel and R was utilized for the calculations.

The review examined studies published between January 2013 and December 2015, utilizing a range of databases including Ovid ‘Medline & EMBASE,’ Scopus, and EconLit, along with grey literature from reputable health organizations.

### Results:
The review analyzed 5187 titles and abstracts concluded into 214 studies were included, of which 187 estimated the AMR burden from the patient perspective, 75 from the healthcare system perspective, and only 11 from the economic perspective. The most individually studied genus was:

Staphylococcus (23%, 50/214), followed by Klebsiella (9%, 19/214) and Acinetobacter (8%, 18/214). The countries that individually produced the highest number of studies were the United States (19%, 40/214), followed by South Korea (7%, 15/214) and Spain (6%, 13/214).

The different estimating Perspective of the burden of AMR
Estimating the patient burden of AMR

the total studies the Review collected was 187 studies the 95% (177/187) of studies estimating patient burden calculated mortality burden, While the remaining 5% (10/187) focusing on morbidity burden. Of those estimating a mortality burden. 48% of studies found AMR had a significant impact on mortality. Studies focusing on resistance on morbidity mainly focused on clinical outcomes like clinical failure, time to stability, recurring infections, or secondary infections. Most studies found resistance to be associated with higher mortality. However, there is no clear consensus on the impact of bacterial resistance mechanisms on mortality outcomes. Only one study estimated the potential patient burden of AMR via secondary effects, estimating that a 30% reduction in antibiotic prophylaxis for certain surgical and chemotherapeutic procedures would result in 6300 infection-related deaths annually.

Estimating the healthcare system burden of AMR
Of 75 studies, 64 estimated length of stay (LoS) burden and 31 estimated monetary cost. Most LoS studies (69%) found statistically significant impacts of resistance, though 39% used simple significance testing against descriptive statistics.

Thirteen studies estimated excess LoS due to resistant infections, with three using multistate modeling to adjust for time dependency bias. Most excess LoS estimates focused on Gram-positive bacteria. vancomycin resistance on Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections showed excess LoS of 12.8 days in Australia, 11.5 days in Switzerland, and 11.43 days for American Veterans, using time-adjusted methods.

#### Conclusion
Due to the small sample size of studies on the economic burden, no consensus can be made regarding the method for estimating it. Regarding healthcare system costs, estimates varied widely, from no significant impact to identifying a cost of one billion dollars per year.

The review highlights the need for more rigorous methodologies in future AMR research. It notes a disparity in research focus, with more studies on patient burden than healthcare system and economic impacts. Further investigation into AMR's secondary effects across all perspectives is recommended.

Future studies should employ robust economic models and multivariate approaches to enhance the accuracy and comparability of AMR burden estimates, crucial for informing policy decisions and guiding effective AMR interventions.
